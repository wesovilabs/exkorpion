we were never caught    
    
we partied the southwest, smoked it from L.A. to El Dorado     
worked odd jobs between delusions of escape    
drunk on the admonitions of parents, parsons & professors     
driving faster than the road or law allowed.     
our high-pitched laughter was young, heartless & disrespected     
authority. we could be heard for miles in the night     
    
the Grand Canyon of a new manhood.    
womanhood discovered    
like the first sighting of Mount Wilson    
    
we rebelled against the southwestern wind     
    
we got so naturally ripped, we sprouted wings,      
crashed parties on the moon, and howled at the earth     
    
we lived off love. It was all we had to eat    
    
when you split you took all the wisdom    
and left me the worry
