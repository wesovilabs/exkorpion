# Exkorpion

**Exkorpion is a framework that will help developers to write tests in a BDD form.**

## Installation

Library is [available in Hex](http://hexdocs.pm/exkorpion), the package can be installed as:

  1. Add `exkorpion` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

    ```elixir
    def deps do
      [{:exkorpion, "~> 0.0.1"}]
    end
    ```

  2. Ensure `exkorpion` is started before your application:

    ```elixir
    def application do
      [applications: [:exkorpion]]
    end
    ```

## Getting started with Exkorpion

As was mentioned above Exkorpion is a test framework focused on helping developers to work under BDD.  Then, as you could guess the syntax
will look like Given-When-Then.  

Below you can find some very basic examples of how to use  **Exkorpion**


```elixir
  defmodule ExkorpionSamples.MathExamplesTest do
    use Exkorpion

    def sum a, b do
      a + b
    end

    def subs a, b do
      a - b
    end



    @demo
    scenario "testing sum operation works as expected" do
   
      beforeEach do
        %{a: 12}
      end


      it "does multiple operations depending on vairable input" do

        %{
          with: fn ctx->
          [
            %{param1: ctx.a, param2: 3, result: 15, op: fn a,b -> sum(a,b) end},
            %{param1: 3, param2: -2, result: 5, op: fn a,b -> subs(a,b) end}
          ]
          end,
          given: fn ctx ->
          %{a: ctx.param1, b: ctx.param2}
          end,
          
          when: &(%{c: &1.op.(&1.a ,&1.b)}),
          then: fn ctx ->
          should :eq,  ctx.c, ctx.result
          end
        }
      end
    end  
    
    scenario "testing sum operation works as expected 2" do
      
      beforeEach do
        %{a: 10}
      end

      it "sum positive numbers works as expected" do
        %{
          given: &(%{a: &1.a, b: 2}),
          when: &(%{c: &1.a + &1.b}),
          then: &(should(:eq, &1.c, 12))
        }
      end

      it "sum negative numbers and it should work as expected" do
        %{
        given: &(%{a: &1.a, b: -2}),
        when: &(%{c: sum(&1.a ,&1.b)}),
        then: &(should(:eq, &1.c, 8))
        }
      end

    end

  end
```
   
    
In order to write new tests with Exkorpion, we need to consider the below:
    
1. Add **use Exkorpion** after module declaration.

2. A **scenario** will be compounds by one of multiple cases, which are represented by **it*

3. So far, we can write two types of tests: 
    
    - We can write basic tests with the required 3 steps: Given, When and Then and the tests will be performed in this order. An example of this
    type of tests can be found in the above example: **it sum positive numbers works as expected** and **it does multiple operations depending on vairable input**
    
    
    - We could extend the test by defining different inputs for the same tests. We can achieve by adding **with** to our map declaration, as we can see in
    **it does multiple operations depending on vairable input**
    
    
## Project status

Just starting with basic functionality to hopefully get some feedback and continue working on new functionalities.

## Roadmap

Since this project just started as a PoC  there's not yet a real Roadmap,  this will be available very soon.

## Stable version

So far only 0.0.1 version is launched.
