# Exkorpion

**An Elixir framework to do testing in a BDD way**

## Installation

Library is [available in Hex](http://hexdocs.pm/exkorpion), the package can be installed as:

  1. Add `exkorpion` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

    ```elixir
    def deps do
      [{:exkorpion, "~> 0.0.2"}]
    end
    ```


In case of you don't have a elixir environment ready to code, please have a look at the below links:

  - [Elixir installation](http://elixir-lang.org/install.html)
  - [Mix introduction](http://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/mix-otp/introduction-to-mix.html)
  - [Mix dependencies](https://hex.pm/docs/usage)


## Exkorpion goals

  - It wraps ExUnit and enhances their features providing developers with a BDD syntax. 

  - It helps us to write tests wasy-to-read.

  - It is completely compatible with ExUnit.

  - It force us to structure our tests in steps (given-when-then)

  - It is based on a functional syntax, organization our tests steps by anonymous functions.

  - It is not coupled to any other framework.


## Getting started


### Exkorpion syntax

As was mentioned on the above Exkorpion is mainly oriented to a bdd syntax:

**scenario**:  A scenario groups multiple cases that test a functionality works as expected. By using scenario we achieve the below:

  - Better documentation for other developers.
  - Test are better organized and structured
  - Working under an agile methodology we can match scenarios to acceptance criteria

**it**: Exkorpion provide with a reserved word It to represent any of the cases inside a scenario.


  Example:
  

    ```elixir

      scenario "testing sum operation works as expected" do

         it "sum positive numbers works as expected" do

         end

         it "sum negative numbers and it should work as expected" do

         end

      end
    ```


Below you can find some very basic examples of how to use  **Exkorpion**


```elixir

  defmodule Exkorpion.MathExamplesTest do
  use Exkorpion

  def sum a, b do
    a + b
  end

  def subs a, b do
    a - b
  end


  
  scenario "testing sum operation works as expected" do
 
    beforeEach do
      %{a: 12}
    end


    it "does multiple operations depending on vairable input" do

      %{
        with: fn ctx ->
        [
          %{param1: ctx.a, param2: 3, result: 15, op: fn a,b -> sum(a,b) end},
          %{param1: 3, param2: -2, result: 5, op: fn a,b -> subs(a,b) end}
        ]
        end,
        given: fn ctx ->
          %{a: ctx.param1, b: ctx.param2}
        end,
        when: &(%{c: &1.op.(&1.a ,&1.b)}),
        then: fn ctx ->
          assert ctx.c === ctx.result
        end
      }
    end
  end  
  
  scenario "testing sum operation works as expected 2" do
    
    beforeEach do
      %{a: 10}
    end

    it "sum positive numbers works as expected" do
      %{
        given: &(%{a: &1.a, b: 3}),
        when: &(%{c: &1.a + &1.b}),
        then: fn ctx ->
          assert ctx.c === 13
        end
      }
    end

    it "sum negative numbers and it should work as expected" do
      %{
        given: &(%{a: &1.a, b: -2}),
        when: &(%{c: sum(&1.a ,&1.b)}),
        then: fn ctx ->
          assert ctx.c === 8
        end
      }
    end

  end

end

```
   
    
## How to run

- Make a **scenarios** directory in your project
- Add files with sufix **_scenario.ex** or **_scenario.exs**
- Implementing some test as example above.
- Run  command **MIX_ENV=test mix exkorpion**
