# Exkorpion

**Exkorpion is a framework that will help developers to write tests in a BDD form.**

## Installation

Library is [available in Hex](http://hexdocs.pm/exkorpion), the package can be installed as:

  1. Add `exkorpion` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

    ```elixir
    def deps do
      [{:exkorpion, "~> 0.0.1"}]
    end
    ```

  2. Ensure `exkorpion` is started before your application:

    ```elixir
    def application do
      [applications: [:exkorpion]]
    end
    ```

## Getting started with Exkorpion

As was mentioned above Exkorpion is a test framework focused on helping developers to work under BDD.  Then, as you could guess the syntax
will look like Given-When-Then.  

Below you can find some very basic examples of use of **Exkorpion**


     ```elixir
    defmodule ExkorpionDemo.MathOperationsTest do
        use Exkorpion
    
        def sum(a,b) do
            a + b
        end
    
        def subs a, b do
          a - b
        end
        
        scenario "testing sum operation works as expected" do
        
                it "sum positive numbers works as expected" do
                    %{
                        given: fn -> %{a: 1, b: 2} end,
        
                        when: fn ctx ->
                            %{c: ctx.a + ctx.b}
                        end,
                        then: fn ctx ->
                            assert ctx.c === 3
                        end
                    }
                end
        
                it "sum negative numbers and it should work as expected" do
                  %{
                    given: fn  ->
                        %{a: -1, b: -2}
                    end,
                    when: fn ctx ->
                        %{c: sum(ctx.a, ctx.b)}
                    end,
                    then: fn ctx ->
                        assert ctx.c === -3
                    end
                  }
                end
        
                it "does multiple operations depending on vairable input" do
        
                  %{
                      with: fn ->
                        [
                            %{param1: 2, param2: 3, result: 5},
                            %{param1: 3, param2: -2, result: 1}
                        ]
                      end,
                      given: fn ctx ->
                        %{a: ctx.param1, b: ctx.param2}
                      end,
                      when: fn ctx ->
                        %{c: sum(ctx.a, ctx.b)}
                      end,
                      then: fn ctx ->
                        assert ctx.c === ctx.result
                      end
                  }
                end
       end
    end
    ```
